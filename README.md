I am a data scientist with a strong background in data analysis and machine learning. My expertise lies in effectively harnessing and analyzing data to derive valuable insights. I have a proven track record of applying advanced statistical and machine-learning techniques to tackle complex data challenges, especially time series. My experience includes developing predictive models, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful information from diverse datasets. I am dedicated to utilizing my skills to drive data-driven decision-making and contribute to the field of data science.

# Time Series Forecasting with HuggingFace Transformers and Gluonts 

This project will help you to build a foundation for using HuggingFace Transformers on any kind of time-related datasets. Here we are trying to see the use of deep learning-based time series frameworks like Gluonts and HuggingFace Transformer to generate the forecast predictions.

### Goals
Learning about the 
  1. How to use the Huggingface Transformer
  2. Use of Gluonts (a deep learning-based time series forecasting engine)
  3. Generate the predictions
  4. And deep dive into HuggingFace Transformers

💻 Hardware support: Might take longer for 8GM RAM systems. Suggest to move Google Colab 

🔋 Try with your own: Take any forecast/demand data and make use of it to get useful insights.

### Techniques and Library includes (just a demo 😃)
```
1. Load input tourism data using the **datasets** library (you can use any time series data you want)
2. Transform the time index using custom functions and partial modules
3. Define some features - Lags features, Time features, and statistic categorical features
4. Set the rules or config using TimeSeriesTransformerConfig, TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction modules
5. Create the features and apply some transformations like missing value treatment and removing unwanted columns using the Chain module
6. Using the module as_stacked_batches, create multiple batches of the time series for training
7. Using the model object, pass all target time series and features
8. Call the Accelerator module and select the GPU/CPU
9. Run 100 Epochs, train the model, calculate the gradient, and find the loss
10. Evaluate the model using the model. Use eval() on test datasets called test_dataloader
11. Calculate the MASE and SMAPE
12. Print the forecast on the test data
```

## Getting Started
Follow the below instructions on setting up your project. Nothing much is needed to run the code, just Google Colab, and it's you :)

### Installation

1. Fork/clone the repo: Clone it on your suitable path
git clone https://github.com/Umesh92x/TimeSeriesTransformer.git

### Execution 

#### Step 1
Once it is forked, it contains
1. Link to Google Colab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QtEoqxdBEe7NIsEHRsP477ivXAxQXVoS?usp=sharing
2. You cab either copy the code and paste it into any desired notebook (Either Google Colab or Github Workspace)

#### Output
Output from one time series Product/Id
